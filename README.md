# Dream A Way Out

The repo doesn't have any SDL dlls

Use WASD keys to move up,left, down, and right respectively.
Use Left Mouse click to attack enemies.

The levels are procedurally generated, the player and camera are placed in a random room at the beginning of the game.

There are 3 enemy types: 
  A spider that moves about the room randomly dropping webs that do damage.
  An eyeball that stays in one place shooting projectiles at you.
  A glop that chases you around the room, doing damage on touch.
  
There are 2 pick up items that randomly drop from enemies when defeated.
There is a boulder that the player can interact with by moving it.
